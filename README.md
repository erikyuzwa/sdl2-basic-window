# SDL2 Basic Window

This is a basic C project to demonstrate how to setup and initialize an SDL2
application used for game development.

## Developer Notes

I'm working on Windows, but I downloaded the MingW release of the SDL2 library
available at: https://libsdl.org

- `git clone git@github.com:erikyuzwa/sdl2-basic-window.git`
- `cd sdl2-basic-window`
- Open the project with your favorite editor (I'm using CLion in this one)
- *BE SURE TO COPY THE `bin/SDL2.dll` into your `cmake-build-debug` folder when it's created*

## Keys

- `ESC` key closes the game
- `F1` toggles between windowed and fullscreen modes
